# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## Set-up:
1. Check if you have Python3 installed with `python3 --version`, if you have it, you are all done!
2. If you don't have Python3, and you are on Windows or Linux, run: 
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3
```
If you are on a Mac, run:
```
brew install python3
```
3. Verify that you installed Python3 by running: `python3 --version`

## Usage:
1. Download a book of your choice (in .txt format) into the books subfolder inside this repository/folder.
2. Run `python3 main.py books/{name-of-your-boox-text-file-without-brackets}.txt`
3. Enjoy your report about the book you provided in the terminal!
